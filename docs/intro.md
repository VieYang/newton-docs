# What is Newton?

## Introduction

[Newton](https://newtonproject.org) is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications(DApp) and infrastructure for the community economy.

## NEW

NEW is the native token of Newton Project. Itâ€™s a hard-capped, scarce asset that is used to pay for fees, secure the platform through staking, and provide a basic unit of account between the multiple subnets created on Newton. `1 NEW` is equal to `1000000000000000000 ISAAC`.
